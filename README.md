## Course outline
The main learning goal of the course is to understand the theory and practice of *Answer Set Programming (ASP)*, and to learn how to use ASP to solve problems that have a combinatorial aspect to them.

The course will take four weeks.
We will do (roughly) the following in the four weeks:
- Week 1:
  - Introduction to the area of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning
  - Propositional satisfiability and SAT solving
  - Basics of Answer Set Programming
- Week 2:
  - The ASP problem modelling and solving workflow
  - Practice problem modelling and solving
  - Homework assignment (theoretical)
- Week 3:
  - Advanced ASP features and techniques
  - Advanced problem modelling and solving
  - Homework assignment (programming)
- Week 4:
  - Some additional theoretical aspects of ASP
  - Preparing for the final exam
  - The final exam
